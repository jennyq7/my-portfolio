# My Portflio

This portfolio was created to give an overview of my work and background!

## Getting Started:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```

Install tailwind css: after installing react:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```
Then in your index or styles.css add:

```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

## Tech stack:

This project was created with HTML, Tailwind CSS, React and som JSX. It was deployed through Azure Static Web App.
Github was used as a repository.

## Lessons:
This is was my first project using TailwindCSS. I had fun looking up the classes on their documentation and learning how to use them. And I learned how to use Tailwind with React. 
I believe SASS is more flexible but Tailwind is faster.
